# Basic Tutorial Message

Requires: TextMeshPro. Please import the Unity TextMeshPro first before using this asset.

This is a small free component that allows you to create a tutorial message pointing to an object in the world or a UI object. With this, you will be able to start from this to create step-by-step tutorials for your players.

If you need different font or font size, you can change them in the prefab. As long as the text component can still resize itself based on the content, this tool should work.



Since it's a free asset, the use case might be a bit limited to what you see in the example. Do feel free to contact me if you encounter an issue though. qlgamedev@gmail.com
